**Theon** is a Rust library that abstracts Euclidean spaces and integrates with
various crates and types in the Rust ecosystem. Theon can be used by libraries
to avoid choosing specific math or linear algebra crates on behalf of their
dependents.

## Geometric Traits

Theon provides geometric traits that model [Euclidean spaces][space]. These
traits are not always mathematically rigorous, but this allows them to be
implemented for many types. APIs are designed for computations in lower
dimensional Euclidean spaces, but traits and types are generic with respect to
dimension.

## Integrations

Theon provides optional implementations for commonly used crates in the Rust
ecosystem, including [`glam`] and [`ultraviolet`]. These implementations can be
enabled using Cargo features.

| Feature                | Crate           | Version  | Support  |
|------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| `geometry-cgmath`      | [`cgmath`]      | `0.18.0` | Complete |
| `geometry-glam`        | [`glam`]        | `0.17.1` | Complete |
| `geometry-mint`        | [`mint`]        | `0.5.6`  | Partial  |
| `geometry-nalgebra`    | [`nalgebra`]    | `0.28.0` | Complete |
| `geometry-ultraviolet` | [`ultraviolet`] | `0.8.1`  | PartialÂ¹ |

Integrated crates are re-exported in the `integration` module. Because a given
version of Theon implements traits for specific versions of integrated crates,
care must be taken to align these versions. Dependent crates can either use the
re-exported crates provided by Theon with no direct dependency or ensure that
the version of a supported crate resolves to the same version for which Theon
implements its traits.

\[1\]: Importantly, traits and features are not yet implemented for SIMD types
like `Wec3`.

## Spatial Queries

Geometric queries can be performed using any types that implement the
appropriate geometric traits.

```rust
use nalgebra::Point2;
use theon::adjunct::Converged;
use theon::query::{Aabb, Intersection, Ray, Unit};
use theon::space::EuclideanSpace;

type E2 = Point2<f64>;

let aabb = Aabb::<E2> {
    origin: EuclideanSpace::origin(),
    extent: Converged::converged(1.0),
};
let ray = Ray::<E2> {
    origin: EuclideanSpace::from_xy(-1.0, 0.5),
    direction: Unit::x(),
};
assert_eq!(Some((1.0, 2.0)), ray.intersection(&aabb));
assert_eq!(None, ray.reverse().intersection(&aabb));
```

In the above example, it is possible to replace the `E2` type definition with
types from [`cgmath`], [`glam`], or any other type that implements
`EuclideanSpace`, etc.

## LAPACK

Some queries require solving linear systems of arbitrary and non-trivial size.
To support these queries, the `lapack` feature depends on [`ndarray`] and
[LAPACK][lapack] libraries. For example, `Plane::from_points` is enabled by the
`lapack` feature and computes a best-fit plane using a singular value
decomposition.

The `lapack` feature only supports Linux at this time.
